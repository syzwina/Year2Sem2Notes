# Vector CRT Display
- needs to refresh display multiple times
- because when we write something, it glows for a while, then disappears

# Raster Graphics Display
- a block of memory is mapped to the display

# Difference between Vector Graphics and Raster Graphics
## Raster Graphics
	- digital, 2D array of pixels
	- images must be sampled
	- more samples, better fidelity
	- but always an approximation
	- more pixels, better approximation
| note: in computer graphics, everything is an approximation
